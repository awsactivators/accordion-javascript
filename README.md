# JavaScript Accordion

This project is a simple, interactive accordion built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to expand and collapse sections by clicking on their headers. When a section is opened, any previously opened section is automatically closed, ensuring only one section is visible at a time. The design is fully customizable and can be easily adapted for various use cases.
